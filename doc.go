// Package libraw provides Go bindings for LibRaw.
//
// This module is intentionally split into a small public API and an internal
// cgo bridge. Public types own Go-level lifecycle and error semantics. The
// internal bridge owns direct calls into LibRaw and should not be imported by
// consumers.
//
// LibRaw itself must be available to the Go toolchain when cgo is enabled. The
// build bridge prefers pkg-config and also recognizes standard Homebrew LibRaw
// prefixes on macOS.
//
// Processor values own a LibRaw handle. Call Close when finished. Close is
// idempotent, so deferred cleanup is safe even if earlier cleanup already ran.
